An HTML5 remake of the classic game, Snake!

Upon reading how to create platform games in HTML5, I decided to have some fun and re-create one of the all-time favourites, Snake!
Snake5.com was taken, so I went with 5nake.com.

- Pressing enter will re-start the game in a glitchy manner.
- Styling improvements required.

Coming Soon
-----------
- Pause/Resume functionality.
- Looping walls
- Maps
- Bonus foods
- Alternative phone backgrounds
- Full-screen and resolution options
- Sounds
- High-scores
- Full-game replay

Version History

### v1.0.000 (2013-Jan-26)
- Classic Snake launched with 9 difficulty settings, screenshot capabilities, scoring system, and more.
